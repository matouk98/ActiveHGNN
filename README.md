# Active HGNN

In this repository, we provide the implementation of "Active Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Per-step Meta-Q-Learning"

## Prerequisites 

python 3.7, CUDA 11.2, torch 1.8.0, numpy 1.16.2

## Usage

Use "python agent.py" to train the active learning agent on source graph

Use "python per_mql.py" to update the learned policy with information from target graph
